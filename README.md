## Description
***MusicTheoryBot*** is a **Telegram bot** that was made to help musicians.   
It can build all *intervals*, lots of different *chords* and 6 *scales*! Everything goes with special audio; scales go with songs examples.   
Our bot also has great *exercising features*! Maybe practising with our bot will grant you with erfect pitch one day:)  

## Features
### Intervals building
You can simply build any of 11 intervals from any note.  
***Audio***: two notes playing simultaneously.  

### Chords building
You can build **major, minor, diminished or augmented** chord from every note.   
You can also add some notes to get **6, maj6, 7 or maj7** chord *(only available for major and minor chords).*  
***Audio***: full built chord.  

### Scales building
You can easily build **Major, Minor, Major Pentatonic, Minor Pentatoic, Blues or Dorian** scale from every note.  
Major and Minor scales go with list of songs, which were written in scale you built. I used this dataset:   
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maharshipandya/-spotify-tracks-dataset  
***Audio***: scale arpeggio.

### Exercises
You can practice identifying notes and intervals using our *SpEcIaL* exercises!  
You will get 5 audios with 4 options every. Try to choose the right option!  
*Btw my highest score is 5\5 (my lowest is 0\5)*
